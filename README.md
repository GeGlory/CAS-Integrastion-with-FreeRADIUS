This repository is a documentation of the apereo CAS development project using FreeRADIUS as an Authentication Service. In this study, there are several related folders containing apereo cas files, cas configuration files, freeradius, apache-based apereo CAS clients and PHP which have been configured based on topology and system requirements.

In this study, the CAS and FreeRadius servers used the ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system, Apache2 v.2.4.4.1, FreeRADIUS v.3 and Apereo CAS V.6.2.x.
